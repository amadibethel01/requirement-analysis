# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction

This repository serves as a foundational resource for understanding and applying Requirement Analysis within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It documents the process of gathering, analyzing, and structuring requirements for a real-world project ‚Äî a Booking Management System.

The goal of this project is to simulate a professional environment where clear, structured, and scalable requirements lay the groundwork for successful software development. Through diagrams, documentation, and structured tasks, this project demonstrates how to bridge business needs with technical solutions.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that involves the process of identifying, gathering, analyzing, and validating the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a proposed software system.

It serves as the foundation for all subsequent stages of development ‚Äî from system design to testing ‚Äî ensuring that the final product meets user expectations, business objectives, and technical constraints.

### üîç Key Objectives of Requirement Analysis:
- To understand the **problem domain** and the scope of the system to be built.
- To define **functional requirements** (what the system should do).
- To identify **non-functional requirements** (how the system should perform).
- To document all requirements in a clear, unambiguous, and structured format.
- To serve as a basis for **system validation** and **project planning**.

### üìå Importance in the SDLC:
- **Minimizes misunderstandings** between developers and stakeholders.
- **Reduces costly rework** by identifying inconsistencies early.
- **Aligns the development process** with business and user needs.
- **Improves project estimation** (cost, time, and resources).
- **Ensures traceability** from requirements to implementation and testing.

Requirement Analysis is not a one-time activity; it is an **iterative and collaborative process** involving continuous communication between business analysts, developers, testers, stakeholders, and end-users.

In summary, Requirement Analysis lays the **blueprint** for building reliable, user-centered, and goal-driven software systems.
