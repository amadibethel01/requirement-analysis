# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction

This repository serves as a foundational resource for understanding and applying Requirement Analysis within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It documents the process of gathering, analyzing, and structuring requirements for a real-world project â€” a Booking Management System.

The goal of this project is to simulate a professional environment where clear, structured, and scalable requirements lay the groundwork for successful software development. Through diagrams, documentation, and structured tasks, this project demonstrates how to bridge business needs with technical solutions.

Stay tuned as we build out the requirement specification phase step by step.
